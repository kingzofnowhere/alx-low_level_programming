This project is about compilation using gcc, entry points, and text-printing functions in C.

Tasks

0-preprocessor: A script that runs a C file saved in the variable $CFILE through the preprocessor and result is saved into another file c.

1-compiler: A script that compiles a C file saved in the variable $CFILE but does not link, The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
Example: If the C file is main.c, the output is main.o.

2-assembler: A script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable $CFILE, and saved in an output file of the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
Example: If the C file is main.c, the result is main.s.

3-name: A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE.

4-puts.c: C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line, using the function puts.

5-printf.c: C program that prints exactly with proper grammer, but the outcome is a piece of art, followed by a new line, using the function printf.

6-size.c: C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. Your program should return 0

100-intel: A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saved in an output file. C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE, The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c
Example: If the C file is main.c, the output is main.s.

101-quote.c: C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error, using function write. your program should return 1.
